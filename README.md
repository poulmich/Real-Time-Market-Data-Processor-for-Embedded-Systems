# Real-Time-Market-Data-Processor-for-Embedded-Systems
A high-performance C application designed to stream and analyze financial market data in real-time, built for cross-compilation to Raspberry Pi and other ARM-based embedded platforms. This system connects to Finnhub's WebSocket API to capture live ticker data for stocks and cryptocurrencies, and process in real time  the candlestick (min-max price,transcactions volume sum), and moving average analytics. The architecture leverages libwebsockets for efficient network communication, while maintaining thread-safe operation through mutexes and condition variables. Designed for resource-constrained environments, it logs processed metrics to structured files with minimal overhead.
